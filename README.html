# Installing and Running iSpin with WSL and Ubuntu on Windows

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to install the Spin model checker and iSpin on Windows using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with Ubuntu.

## Prerequisites
- A Windows 10 or 11 machine with WSL 2 support.

---

## Step 1: Install WSL on Windows

1. *Open PowerShell as Administrator*:
   - Press Windows + X and select Windows PowerShell (Admin).

2. *Install WSL*:
   powershell
   wsl --install
   
   - This command installs WSL 2 and the default Linux distribution (Ubuntu).
   - Restart your computer if prompted.

3. *Launch Ubuntu*:
   - After the restart, search for Ubuntu in the Start menu and launch it. It may take a few moments for the setup to complete.

## Step 2: Install Required Packages on Ubuntu (WSL)

1. *Update the Package List*:
   bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt upgrade
   

2. *Install Spin*:
   bash
   sudo apt install spin
   

3. *Install Tcl/Tk* (for iSpin):
   bash
   sudo apt install tcl tk
   

4. *Install Graphviz* (for visualizations):
   bash
   sudo apt install graphviz
   

5. *Install GCC* (if not already installed):
   bash
   sudo apt install gcc

## Step 3: Download and Set Up iSpin

1. *Download Spin and iSpin*:
   - Transfer the pc_spin651.zip file to the WSL environment, or download it directly within WSL using:
     bash
     wget http://spinroot.com/spin/Src/spin651.tgz
     

2. *Extract the Downloaded File*:
   - If using pc_spin651.zip, extract it:
     bash
     unzip pc_spin651.zip -d ~/spin
     
   - If using spin651.tgz, extract it:
     bash
     tar -xvzf spin651.tgz
     

3. *Navigate to the Directory*:
   bash
   cd ~/spin
   

---

## Step 4: Run iSpin (Using wish)

iSpin requires the wish interpreter, which is provided by Tcl/Tk.

1. *Launch iSpin with wish*:
   bash
   wish ispin.tcl
   
   - If everything is installed correctly, the iSpin graphical interface should open in a new window.

---

## Step 5: Using Spin and iSpin in WSL (Optional)

For those who want to use Spin directly from the command line in the WSL environment:

1. *Running a Promela Model*:
   - Write a Promela model and save it as a .pml file.
   - Navigate to the directory containing the .pml file and execute:
     bash
     spin -a model.pml
     
   - Compile the generated pan.c file:
     bash
     gcc -o pan pan.c
     
   - Run the verifier:
     bash
     ./pan
     

---

## Summary of Commands
- *Install WSL*: wsl --install
- *Update Ubuntu*: sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
- *Install Spin*: sudo apt install spin
- *Install Tcl/Tk*: sudo apt install tcl tk
- *Install Graphviz*: sudo apt install graphviz
- *Run iSpin*: wish ispin.tcl

---

## Conclusion
Using WSL with Ubuntu provides a Linux-like environment on Windows, making it easier to run tools like iSpin. The optional Step 5 allows for command-line verifications directly through WSL, ideal for those familiar with Linux tools.

Feel free to modify this guide as needed to suit your installation process or environment.
